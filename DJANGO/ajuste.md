Certainly! To handle the association of workouts with existing exercises and prevent unnecessary creation of new exercises, you can modify the `register_workout` view to allow the user to select an existing exercise or create a new one if needed. Here's a modified approach:

1. Modify the `register_workout` template to include a dropdown menu or autocomplete feature to select an existing exercise or add a new one.
   
   ```html
   <label for="exercise">Exercise:</label>
   <select id="exercise" name="exercise">
     <option value="" disabled selected>Select or Add Exercise</option>
     {% for exercise in exercises %}
       <option value="{{ exercise.id }}">{{ exercise.name }}</option>
     {% endfor %}
   </select>
   <a href="{% url 'register_exercise' %}" class="btn btn-primary">Add new exercise</a>
   ```

2. Modify the `register_workout` view to handle the selection of an existing exercise or the creation of a new one.

   ```python
   def register_workout(request):
       if request.method == 'POST':
           form = WorkoutForm(request.POST)
           if form.is_valid():
               # Check if an existing exercise was selected or a new one needs to be created
               exercise_id = request.POST.get('exercise')
               if exercise_id:
                   # Use the existing exercise
                   exercise = Exercise.objects.get(id=exercise_id)
               else:
                   # Create a new exercise
                   exercise_name_string = request.POST.get('exercise_name')
                   exercise, _ = Exercise.objects.get_or_create(name=exercise_name_string)

               # Save the workout
               workout = Workout.objects.create(
                   exercise=exercise,
                   date=timezone.now().date(),
                   sets=form.cleaned_data['sets'],
                   weight=form.cleaned_data['weight'],
                   rest_time=form.cleaned_data['rest_time'],
                   notes=form.cleaned_data['notes']
               )

               # Save reps for each set
               for set_number in range(1, form.cleaned_data['sets'] + 1):
                   reps_field_name = f'reps_set_{set_number}'
                   reps_value = request.POST.get(reps_field_name)
                   SetReps.objects.create(workout=workout, set_number=set_number, reps=reps_value)

               return redirect('workout_detail', workout_id=workout.id)
       else:
           form = WorkoutForm()
           exercises = Exercise.objects.all()

       return render(request, 'register_workout.html', {'form': form, 'exercises': exercises})
   ```

In this approach, the user can select an existing exercise from a dropdown menu and associate it with the new workout. If the user wants to add a new exercise, they can do so by clicking the "Add new exercise" link, which will take them to the registration page for a new exercise.

This modification aims to prevent the creation of unnecessary exercise entries and ensures that the user can select an existing exercise if they want to associate the workout with one that already exists.
