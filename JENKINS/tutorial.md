Step-by-step tutorial on how to set up Jenkins for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) of a Flask application. In this tutorial, we'll create a simple Flask application, set up Jenkins, and automate the deployment process using a basic example.

**Prerequisites:**
- A Flask application (you can use an existing one or create a simple one for this tutorial).
- A version control system (e.g., Git) to manage your Flask application's code.
- A server or cloud platform where you can install Jenkins (for this tutorial, we'll assume Jenkins is already set up).

**Step 1: Create a Flask Application**

For this example, we'll create a basic Flask application that displays "Hello, Jenkins!" when accessed.

```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, Jenkins!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Step 2: Set Up Version Control**

Ensure that your Flask application code is in a version control system (e.g., Git). Initialize a Git repository in your project directory and commit your code.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

**Step 3: Install Jenkins**

Assuming you have a server or platform where Jenkins is installed, access the Jenkins web interface and set it up. You may need to install Jenkins plugins related to Git integration and other tools you plan to use.

**Step 4: Create a Jenkins Job**

Now, we'll create a Jenkins job to automate the CI/CD process for our Flask application:

1. Log in to the Jenkins web interface.

2. Click "New Item" to create a new Jenkins job.

3. Choose the "Freestyle project" option and give your job a name (e.g., "FlaskAppCI").

4. Under the "Source Code Management" section, select Git and provide the repository URL of your Flask application.

5. In the "Build Triggers" section, choose how you want to trigger the build. For example, you can select "Poll SCM" and set up a schedule for Jenkins to check for changes in your Git repository periodically.

6. In the "Build" section, add build steps. For a Flask application, this might include:

   - Setting up a virtual environment.
   - Installing dependencies (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
   - Running tests (e.g., `pytest`).

   You can use shell commands or scripts to accomplish these tasks.

7. In the "Post-build Actions" section, you can add actions to be performed after the build is complete. For example, you can archive build artifacts, publish test results, or trigger deployment.

**Step 5: Configure Deployment**

In this example, we'll assume a simple deployment to a local web server for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would configure deployment to a staging or production environment using deployment tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud services.

1. In the Jenkins job configuration, add a post-build action to execute shell commands or scripts for deployment. For instance, you can use `rsync`, `scp`, or other methods to copy your Flask application's code to a web server directory.

   Here's an example shell script for a basic deployment:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Assuming your Flask app code is in /path/to/your/app
   rsync -avz /path/to/your/app/ /var/www/html/flaskapp/
   ```

2. Ensure that the web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) is properly configured to serve your Flask application from the deployment directory.

3. Save the Jenkins job configuration.

**Step 6: Trigger the Jenkins Job**

Now that your Jenkins job is set up, you can manually trigger it or wait for the scheduled polling (if configured) to check for changes in your Git repository.

**Step 7: Monitor the CI/CD Pipeline**

You can monitor the progress of the CI/CD pipeline by accessing the Jenkins web interface and viewing the job's status, console output, and build artifacts.

**Step 8: Access Your Flask Application**

Once the Jenkins job completes successfully, you should be able to access your Flask application by navigating to the appropriate URL. In our example, it would be `http://your-server/flaskapp/`.

**Step 9: Further Enhancements**

In a real-world scenario, you can enhance your Jenkins pipeline by integrating it with additional tools and services, such as automated testing frameworks, containerization (e.g., Docker), cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku), and notification systems (e.g., Slack or email).

Remember to follow security best practices and adjust your CI/CD pipeline to meet the specific requirements and complexities of your Flask application and deployment environment.
