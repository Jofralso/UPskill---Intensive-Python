In this exercise, students will create a basic blog application where they can add and view blog posts. Each blog post should have a title and content.

Set up a Flask application with SQLAlchemy and a SQLite database.
Create a Post model with id, title, and content fields.
Create routes for:
Viewing a list of blog posts (the homepage).
Creating a new blog post.
Viewing an individual blog post.
Implement form validation for creating a new blog post to ensure both title and content are filled out.
Store the blog posts in the database.
Display the list of blog posts on the homepage with links to view individual posts.
When a user clicks on a blog post, show the full post with its title and content.
