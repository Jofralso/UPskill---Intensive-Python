### Exercise 2: Implement Environment Variables

To implement environment variables in your Flask app, you can use the `python-decouple` library. First, install the library:

```bash
pip install python-decouple
```

Then, create a `.env` file in your project's root directory and define your configuration variables:

```ini
SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///mydatabase.db
```

Now, in your Flask app, use `Decouple` to access these variables:

```python
from decouple import config

SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY')
DEBUG = config('DEBUG', default=False, cast=bool)
DATABASE_URL = config('DATABASE_URL')
```
Great, let's move on to Exercise 8:

### Exercise 8: Real-Time Chat with Flask-SocketIO

In this exercise, you'll create a simple real-time chat application using Flask-SocketIO. First, ensure you have Flask-SocketIO installed (`pip install flask-socketio eventlet`).

Here's the basic structure of the chat application:

```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask, render_template
from flask_socketio import SocketIO

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'
socketio = SocketIO(app)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@socketio.on('message')
def handle_message(message):
    print('Received message:', message)
    socketio.emit('message', message, broadcast=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    socketio.run(app, debug=True)
```

This example sets up a Flask app with a single route that renders an HTML page (`index.html`). When a message is received via SocketIO, it's broadcasted to all connected clients.

**Exercise:** Create a new directory for your Flask-SocketIO chat application, and within that directory, create the following files:

1. `app.py`: Implement the Flask app with SocketIO.
2. `templates/index.html`: Create an HTML file for the chat interface.

To run your chat application, use the following commands:

```bash
pip install flask-socketio eventlet
python app.py
```

Access the chat application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000/`. You can open multiple browser tabs to simulate different users.



### Exercise 11: Flask Blueprints for Modular Applications

In this exercise, you'll create a Flask Blueprint for a specific module in your application. This helps organize your code and maintainability.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Create a new directory for your Flask project or use your existing project directory.

2. Within the project directory, create a new Python file for the module you want to modularize (e.g., `auth.py` for authentication features).

3. In `auth.py`, define a Flask Blueprint and add routes to it:

```python
# auth.py

from flask import Blueprint, render_template

auth_blueprint = Blueprint('auth', __name__)

@auth_blueprint.route('/login')
def login():
    return render_template('login.html')

@auth_blueprint.route('/register')
def register():
    return render_template('register.html')
```

4. In your main application file (e.g., `app.py`), import and register the Blueprint:

```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask
from auth import auth_blueprint

app = Flask(__name__)

# Register the auth blueprint with a URL prefix
app.register_blueprint(auth_blueprint, url_prefix='/auth')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

5. Create HTML templates (e.g., `login.html` and `register.html`) in a `templates` folder within your project directory. These templates will be used by the routes defined in the Blueprint.

Your project directory structure might look like this:

```
my_flask_app/
    app.py
    auth.py
    templates/
        login.html
        register.html
```

**Exercise:** Follow these steps to create a Flask Blueprint for a specific module in your Flask app. You can replace the `auth` module with any other module or feature relevant to your application.



### Exercise 12: Using Docker for Containerization

In this exercise, you'll create a Dockerfile to containerize your Flask application and then build and run a Docker container.

Here are the steps:

1. Create a Dockerfile in your project directory (the same directory as your Flask app). Here's an example Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install project dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of your application code into the container
COPY . .

# Command to run your Flask app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

2. Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing your project dependencies.

3. Build the Docker container by running the following command in the same directory as your Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t my-flask-app .
```

Replace `my-flask-app` with a name for your Docker image.

4. Once the build is complete, you can run your Flask app in a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 my-flask-app
```

This command runs the Docker container in detached mode (`-d`) and maps port 5000 from the container to port 5000 on your host machine.

5. Access your Flask app in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000/`.

**Exercise:** Follow these steps to create a Dockerfile for your Flask app, build a Docker container, and run it. Ensure your Flask app runs successfully inside the Docker container.

### Exercise 13: Building a REST API with JWT Authentication

In this exercise, you'll create a basic RESTful API using Flask and implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication.

Here are the steps:

1. Install the necessary packages if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-JWT-Extended
```

2. Set up a basic Flask app with Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT authentication:

```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask, jsonify
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, jwt_required

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'
jwt = JWTManager(app)

@app.route('/protected', methods=['GET'])
@jwt_required()
def protected_route():
    return jsonify(message='This is a protected route.')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, we create a protected route `/protected`, which can only be accessed by authenticated users.

3. You can use a tool like `curl` or an API client like Postman to test your API. To simulate JWT authentication, you'll need to obtain a JWT token first by making a POST request to `/auth`. Here's an example of how you can obtain a token using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "your_username", "password": "your_password"}' http://localhost:5000/auth
```

Replace `"your_username"` and `"your_password"` with appropriate values. This will return a JSON response with a JWT token.

4. With the obtained JWT token, you can make authenticated requests to the protected route:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" http://localhost:5000/protected
```

Replace `"your_jwt_token"` with the actual JWT token you received.

**Exercise:** Implement JWT authentication in your Flask app using Flask-JWT-Extended. Create a protected route, obtain a JWT token, and access the protected route using the token.

### Exercise 14: Design Additional RESTful API Endpoints

In this exercise, you'll extend your Flask app to include additional RESTful API endpoints. This exercise assumes that you already have a basic Flask app with JWT authentication from the previous exercise.

Here are the steps:

1. Define additional API routes in your Flask app to create, read, update, or delete resources. For example:

```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, jwt_required

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'
jwt = JWTManager(app)

# ... Previous code ...

# Example of defining additional API routes
@app.route('/api/items', methods=['GET'])
def get_items():
    # Implement code to retrieve items
    return jsonify(items)

@app.route('/api/items/<int:item_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_item(item_id):
    # Implement code to retrieve a specific item by ID
    return jsonify(item)

@app.route('/api/items', methods=['POST'])
@jwt_required()
def create_item():
    # Implement code to create a new item
    return jsonify(message='Item created successfully')

@app.route('/api/items/<int:item_id>', methods=['PUT'])
@jwt_required()
def update_item(item_id):
    # Implement code to update a specific item by ID
    return jsonify(message='Item updated successfully')

@app.route('/api/items/<int:item_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
@jwt_required()
def delete_item(item_id):
    # Implement code to delete a specific item by ID
    return jsonify(message='Item deleted successfully')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

2. Implement the logic for each API route according to your application's requirements. For example, in the code above, you'll need to define the `get_items`, `get_item`, `create_item`, `update_item`, and `delete_item` functions to handle these API requests.

3. Test your API endpoints using a tool like `curl` or an API client like Postman. You can send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to interact with your API.

**Exercise:** Design additional RESTful API endpoints for your Flask app, implement the necessary logic for each endpoint, and test them to ensure they work as expected.
